      <h2>Find a Furiend Today!</h2>
      <h3>Adoption</h3>
      <p>
        Our goal is to find a loving, life long home for each animal in our
        care. We strive to find the most suitable pet for each person and the
        most suitable home for each animal. To reach that goal, we consider both
        the lifestyle and expectations of potential adopters and the personality
        and needs of each animal. We welcome the opportunity to help match you
        with a wonderful companion and ask that you keep in mind the following
        guidelines to adopting from Acadiana Animal Aid. Please allow 3 days for
        our adoption coordinators to review your application and they will
        contact you.
      </p>
      <h3>Foster</h3>
      <p>
        A foster home is a temporary living situation for our shelter pets.
        Foster families provide shelter, care, and love while our pets await
        placement in a forever home or travel on a transport to an out-of-state
        shelter partner. The number of animals we can save depends entirely on
        the number of people who open their hearts and homes to foster pets.
        Foster homes allow us to create space in the shelter so we can rescue
        more pets in need.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Foster</h4>
      <p>
        Louisiana has a serious pet over population problem. Every day puppies
        and kittens enter municipal shelters and may not make it out alive.
        Fostering provides a life-saving outcome for these pets. Foster homes
        offer an alternative to the shelter environment and provide the
        attention and comfort that only a home setting can provide â€” especially
        for young kittens and puppies, older animals, and frightened pets who
        are having a hard time in the shelter. Foster pets usually stay in their
        temporary home anywhere from a few days to two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fostering has so many rewards: you are able to help a pet in need, enjoy
        the companionship of a pet without a lifetime commitment, try new
        companions for the resident pets in your home, and provide some extra
        TLC to kittens and puppies too young to be adopted.
